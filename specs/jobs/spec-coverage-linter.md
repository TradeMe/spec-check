## Jobs

### SPEC-003/JOB-001: Extract Requirements from Specification Files

**Description:** Users need to automatically discover and extract all requirements from specification documents, creating fully qualified requirement IDs that uniquely identify each requirement across the entire specification set.

**Why It Matters:** Traceability starts with knowing what requirements exist. Fully qualified IDs (SPEC-XXX/REQ-XXX) eliminate ambiguity when multiple specifications might use the same local requirement ID, ensuring precise requirement identification.

**Related Requirements:**
- [SPEC-003/REQ-001](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-001) - Scan specs directory
- [SPEC-003/REQ-002](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-002) - Extract requirement IDs
- [SPEC-003/REQ-003](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-003) - Support custom prefixes
- [SPEC-003/REQ-041](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-041) - Extract spec IDs
- [SPEC-003/REQ-042](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-042) - Form fully qualified IDs

**Success Criteria:**
- All markdown spec files are discovered and scanned
- Requirement IDs (REQ-XXX, NFR-XXX, TEST-XXX) are extracted accurately
- Spec IDs (SPEC-XXX) are identified from metadata
- Fully qualified requirement IDs (SPEC-XXX/REQ-XXX) are created
- Custom requirement prefixes are supported beyond default types

### SPEC-003/JOB-002: Discover and Analyze Test Coverage

**Description:** Users need to automatically find all test files, extract test functions, and identify which requirements each test covers through pytest markers.

**Why It Matters:** Understanding which tests cover which requirements enables validation of complete test coverage and helps identify gaps where requirements lack corresponding tests.

**Related Requirements:**
- [SPEC-003/REQ-004](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-004) - Scan tests directory
- [SPEC-003/REQ-005](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-005) - Parse test files with AST
- [SPEC-003/REQ-006](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-006) - Identify test functions
- [SPEC-003/REQ-007](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-007) - Extract requirement markers
- [SPEC-003/REQ-008](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-008) - Support multiple markers
- [SPEC-003/REQ-009](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-009) - Handle class-based tests

**Success Criteria:**
- All test files matching pattern test_*.py are discovered
- Test functions are identified via naming convention
- Requirement markers (@pytest.mark.req) are extracted
- Tests with multiple requirement markers are handled correctly
- Class-based test names include class prefix (ClassName::test_name)

### SPEC-003/JOB-003: Analyze and Validate Coverage

**Description:** Users need to map requirements to their covering tests, identify gaps, validate requirement references, and calculate overall coverage metrics to ensure specification completeness.

**Why It Matters:** Coverage analysis reveals which requirements lack tests, which tests lack traceability, and whether requirement references are valid. This ensures specifications are fully testable and tests are properly linked.

**Related Requirements:**
- [SPEC-003/REQ-010](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-010) - Create requirement-to-test mapping
- [SPEC-003/REQ-011](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-011) - Identify uncovered requirements
- [SPEC-003/REQ-012](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-012) - Calculate coverage percentage
- [SPEC-003/REQ-013](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-013) - Identify unmarked tests
- [SPEC-003/REQ-043](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-043) - Validate spec ID exists
- [SPEC-003/REQ-044](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-044) - Validate requirement ID exists
- [SPEC-003/REQ-045](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-045) - Report invalid references

**Success Criteria:**
- Each requirement is mapped to its covering tests
- Uncovered requirements are identified
- Coverage percentage is calculated correctly
- Tests without requirement markers are identified
- Invalid requirement references (non-existent specs or requirements) are detected and reported
- Validation ensures test markers reference real requirements

### SPEC-003/JOB-004: Configure Coverage Thresholds

**Description:** Users need to configure minimum acceptable coverage percentages to support gradual coverage improvement and different quality standards across projects.

**Why It Matters:** Not all projects can achieve 100% coverage immediately. Configurable thresholds enable teams to set realistic targets, track improvement over time, and prevent coverage regression.

**Related Requirements:**
- [SPEC-003/REQ-014](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-014) - Load configuration from pyproject.toml
- [SPEC-003/REQ-015](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-015) - Accept min_coverage option
- [SPEC-003/REQ-016](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-016) - Default to 100% coverage
- [SPEC-003/REQ-017](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-017) - Accept 0-100 range
- [SPEC-003/REQ-018](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-018) - Report validation passed
- [SPEC-003/REQ-019](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-019) - Report validation failed

**Success Criteria:**
- Configuration loads from pyproject.toml
- min_coverage threshold is configurable (0-100)
- Default threshold is 100% when not configured
- Validation passes when coverage >= threshold
- Validation fails when coverage < threshold

### SPEC-003/JOB-005: Provide Command-Line Interface

**Description:** Users need a command-line interface with options to customize paths, configure thresholds, and enable verbose output for local development and CI/CD integration.

**Why It Matters:** CLI flexibility enables the tool to work in diverse project structures and provides developers with control over validation behavior and output detail.

**Related Requirements:**
- [SPEC-003/REQ-020](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-020) - Root directory option
- [SPEC-003/REQ-021](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-021) - Default to current directory
- [SPEC-003/REQ-022](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-022) - Custom specs directory
- [SPEC-003/REQ-023](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-023) - Default specs directory
- [SPEC-003/REQ-024](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-024) - Custom tests directory
- [SPEC-003/REQ-025](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-025) - Default tests directory
- [SPEC-003/REQ-026](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-026) - Verbose option
- [SPEC-003/REQ-027](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-027) - Min-coverage CLI override
- [SPEC-003/REQ-028](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-028) - CLI precedence over config

**Success Criteria:**
- Directory paths are customizable (root, specs, tests)
- Sensible defaults minimize required options
- Verbose mode provides detailed output
- Command-line options override configuration file
- Tool works in standard and custom project structures

### SPEC-003/JOB-006: Report Coverage Results

**Description:** Users need comprehensive reporting of coverage metrics, uncovered requirements, unmarked tests, validation status, and appropriate exit codes for automation.

**Why It Matters:** Clear reporting enables quick identification of coverage gaps and actionable next steps, while proper exit codes allow CI/CD pipelines to enforce coverage requirements automatically.

**Related Requirements:**
- [SPEC-003/REQ-029](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-029) - Display coverage percentage
- [SPEC-003/REQ-030](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-030) - Display covered/total requirements
- [SPEC-003/REQ-031](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-031) - Display linked/total tests
- [SPEC-003/REQ-032](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-032) - List uncovered requirements

- [SPEC-003/REQ-039](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-039) - Report errors to stderr
- [SPEC-003/REQ-040](../spec-coverage-linter.md#req-040) - Stack traces in verbose mode

**Success Criteria:**
- Coverage report shows percentage and counts
- Uncovered requirements are listed explicitly
- Tests without markers are identified
- Validation status is clear (passed/failed)
- Exit codes enable CI/CD automation (0=pass, 1=fail)
- Errors are handled gracefully with warnings
- Verbose mode includes detailed diagnostics
