# JOB-002: Maintain Traceability Between Specifications and Tests

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Active

## Context

In specification-driven development, requirements are defined in specification documents before implementation and tests are written. Maintaining traceability between specifications and tests is critical for:
- Ensuring every requirement has corresponding test coverage
- Validating that tests map back to documented requirements
- Identifying gaps where requirements lack tests
- Supporting compliance and audit requirements
- Enabling impact analysis when specifications change

Without automated traceability:
- Requirements can be added without tests, creating untested functionality
- Tests can be added without linking to requirements, creating unclear test purpose
- It's difficult to measure specification coverage or identify gaps
- Manual review of specs and tests is time-consuming and error-prone
- Teams lose confidence that their test suite fully validates all requirements

## Job Story

**When** I'm developing software against formal specifications,

**I want to** automatically track which requirements have test coverage and which tests validate each requirement,

**So that** I can ensure complete testing, identify coverage gaps early, and maintain clear traceability for compliance and quality assurance.

## Pains

### Current Pain Points

1. **Manual Coverage Tracking**: Developers must manually cross-reference specification documents with test files to verify coverage

2. **Silent Coverage Gaps**: Requirements can be added without corresponding tests, and the gap goes unnoticed until code review or audit

3. **Unclear Test Purpose**: Tests without requirement markers make it difficult to understand what specification they validate

4. **No Coverage Metrics**: There's no automated way to calculate what percentage of requirements have test coverage

5. **Invalid References**: Test markers can reference non-existent requirement IDs without detection, breaking traceability

6. **Specification Changes**: When requirements are updated or removed, there's no systematic way to identify affected tests

7. **Audit Challenges**: Compliance audits require proof that all requirements are tested, but manual verification is time-consuming

8. **Team Coordination**: Multiple developers working on specs and tests simultaneously can create synchronization issues

## Gains

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Automated Coverage Analysis**: Coverage metrics are calculated automatically by scanning specs and test files

2. **Gap Identification**: Uncovered requirements and unmarked tests are identified immediately

3. **Clear Traceability**: Every test explicitly declares which requirements it validates via markers

4. **Coverage Enforcement**: CI/CD pipelines can enforce minimum coverage thresholds, preventing untested requirements from merging

5. **Validation**: Test markers referencing non-existent requirements are flagged as errors

6. **Coverage Reports**: Teams get clear reports showing which requirements have tests and which need attention

7. **Configurable Thresholds**: Projects can set realistic coverage targets and track improvement over time

8. **Fast Feedback**: Developers get immediate feedback about coverage gaps without manual cross-referencing

9. **Compliance Ready**: Automated traceability reports support audit requirements with minimal manual effort

10. **Impact Analysis**: When specifications change, affected tests are easily identified through the traceability map
