# REQ-002: Specification Coverage Tracking System

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Active

## Purpose

Provide automated traceability between specification requirements and test implementations to ensure complete test coverage, identify gaps, and maintain clear requirement-to-test mappings for compliance and quality assurance.

## Description

The specification coverage tracking system shall analyze specification documents and test files to:

1. **Requirement Extraction**: Automatically discover and extract all requirement IDs from specification markdown files, creating fully qualified requirement identifiers (SPEC-XXX/REQ-XXX)

2. **Test Discovery**: Parse Python test files using AST analysis to identify test functions and extract pytest requirement markers

3. **Coverage Analysis**: Map requirements to covering tests, identify uncovered requirements, and calculate coverage percentages

4. **Reference Validation**: Validate that test markers reference existing specification IDs and requirement IDs, reporting invalid references

5. **Configurable Thresholds**: Support minimum coverage thresholds configured via pyproject.toml or command-line options

6. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports showing coverage metrics, uncovered requirements, unmarked tests, and validation status

The system shall support both local development workflows and CI/CD pipeline integration with appropriate exit codes.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-01: Extract Requirements from Specifications

**Given** a specifications directory with markdown files
**When** the coverage tracker scans for requirements
**Then** it shall discover all files matching `*.md` in the specs directory
**And** it shall extract specification IDs from frontmatter or titles (SPEC-XXX)
**And** it shall extract requirement IDs from headings or content (REQ-XXX, NFR-XXX, TEST-XXX)
**And** it shall form fully qualified requirement IDs (SPEC-XXX/REQ-XXX)
**And** it shall support custom requirement prefixes beyond the defaults

### AC-02: Discover Tests and Extract Markers

**Given** a tests directory with Python test files
**When** the coverage tracker scans for tests
**Then** it shall discover all files matching `test_*.py`
**And** it shall parse each file using Python AST
**And** it shall identify all test functions (functions starting with `test_`)
**And** it shall extract `@pytest.mark.req("REQ-ID")` markers from functions
**And** it shall support multiple requirement markers on a single test
**And** it shall handle class-based tests with proper naming (ClassName::test_name)

### AC-03: Create Requirement-to-Test Mapping

**Given** extracted requirements and test markers
**When** the coverage tracker analyzes relationships
**Then** it shall create a mapping from each requirement ID to its covering tests
**And** it shall identify requirements with zero covering tests
**And** it shall identify tests without requirement markers
**And** it shall calculate coverage percentage (covered requirements / total requirements * 100)

### AC-04: Validate Requirement References

**Given** test markers referencing requirement IDs
**When** the coverage tracker validates references
**Then** it shall verify each referenced specification ID exists
**And** it shall verify each referenced requirement ID exists within that specification
**And** it shall report tests with invalid specification references
**And** it shall report tests with invalid requirement references
**And** it shall include the test file and function name in error reports

### AC-05: Support Configurable Coverage Thresholds

**Given** a `pyproject.toml` file or command-line options
**When** the coverage tracker loads configuration
**Then** it shall read `min_coverage` from `[tool.spec_check]` section
**And** it shall accept coverage thresholds from 0 to 100
**And** it shall default to 100% coverage when not configured
**And** it shall validate coverage meets or exceeds the threshold
**And** it shall allow command-line options to override config file settings

### AC-06: Generate Comprehensive Reports

**Given** completed coverage analysis
**When** the coverage tracker generates a report
**Then** it shall display the coverage percentage
**And** it shall show covered requirements / total requirements count
**And** it shall show tests with markers / total tests count
**And** it shall list all uncovered requirements by ID
**And** it shall list all tests without requirement markers
**And** it shall display validation status (PASSED/FAILED vs threshold)
**And** it shall use exit code 0 for pass and 1 for fail

### AC-07: Provide Verbose Diagnostics

**Given** the `--verbose` flag is specified
**When** the coverage tracker runs
**Then** it shall display detailed progress information
**And** it shall show the requirement-to-test mapping for each requirement
**And** it shall include stack traces for parsing errors
**And** it shall log file discovery and parsing steps

### AC-08: Handle Errors Gracefully

**Given** unreadable specification files or unparseable test files
**When** the coverage tracker encounters errors
**Then** it shall log warnings for files that cannot be read
**And** it shall log warnings for files that cannot be parsed
**And** it shall continue processing remaining files
**And** it shall report errors to stderr
**And** it shall include error details in verbose mode

## Jobs Addressed

This requirement addresses the following Jobs-to-be-Done:

- **JOB-002**: Maintain Traceability Between Specifications and Tests - This requirement implements automated coverage analysis, gap identification, reference validation, and configurable enforcement to ensure every requirement has test coverage and every test traces back to a requirement.
